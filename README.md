# de.flwi.moneycontrolreport

A little helper to analyze csv-reports generated by the [MoneyControl Apps](http://mobiware.de/moneycontrol) for iOS and Mac OS.

## Requirements

- sbt (brew install sbt)
- elm [Install](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)

## preparation
Perhaps I'll integrate a csv-upload later.

###example report
And example export is placed in `conf/moneyControlReportExample.csv` and can be reached under [http://localhost:9000/report](http://localhost:9000/report)

### To view your own report
For now place an exported csv-file in `conf/foobar.csv` and call [http://localhost:9000/report/foobar.csv](http://localhost:9000/report/foobar.csv).


## build and run
`sbt run`
